<a name="jbichapter"></a>Chapter&#160;2<h3>Java Business Integration</h3><p>Java Business Integration (JBI) is an implementation of the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=208">JSR 208 specification</a> for Java
Business Integration, a standard developed under the Java Community Process (JCP) as an
approach to implementing a service-oriented architecture (SOA).</p><p> JBI defines an environment for plug-in components that interact using a services
model based directly on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 2.0. The plug-in components
function as service providers, service consumers, or both. </p><p>For detailed information on managing the key components of the JBI runtime environment
and their lifecycle states, see the Admin Console Online Help. For information about
using the JBI commands, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-4332"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server 2.1 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p>

<a name="jbienvironment"></a><h3>JBI Environment </h3>
<p>The key components of the JBI environment are covered in the following sections.</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#gevde">JBI Components</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gelqv">Service Assemblies</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#geuwm">Shared Libraries</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#geuxg">JBI Descriptors</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="gevde"></a><h4>JBI Components</h4>


<a name="gevfb"></a><h5>Service Engines</h5>
<a name="indexterm-13"></a><a name="indexterm-14"></a><p>Service Engines are components that provide local services (that is, services within the
JBI environment) and consume local or remote services.</p>

<a name="gevdl"></a><h5>Binding Components</h5>
<a name="indexterm-15"></a><p>Binding Components are proxies for consumers or providers that are outside the JBI
environment. Binding components typically are based on a standard communications protocol, such as
FTP, JMS, or SMTP, or a call to an external service, such as
SAP or WebSphere MQ. </p><p>JBI components have the following lifecyle states:</p>
<ul><li><p> Started</p></li>
<li><p> Stopped</p></li>
<li><p>Shutdown</p></li></ul>
<p>The JBI Runtime persists the life cycle states of JBI Components. When the
server shuts down and then restarts, JBI Components revert to their state at
the time the Enterprise Server shut down. </p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The JBI runtime attempts to revert to the "desired" state of a JBI
component. For example, suppose you tried to start a JBI component but it
did not start due to an error in the component. If you
restart the Enterprise Server, the JBI runtime attempts to start the component again.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can do the following operations on the JBI components. For detailed steps,
log on to the Admin Console, navigate to the JBI node, click
Components and then click Online Help. </p>
<ul><li><p>View JBI components by their specific lifestyle states. </p></li>
<li><p>Install JBI components. </p></li>
<li><p>Uninstall JBI components. </p></li>
<li><p>Manage the lifecycle states of the JBI Components. </p></li>
<li><p>View the general properties of a JBI Component. </p></li>
<li><p>View the configuration information for a JBI Component.</p></li>
<li><p>View the descriptor for a JBI Component. </p></li>
<li><p>Manage JBI Component Loggers.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gevdc"></a><h5>JBI Component Loggers</h5>
<p>Using the Admin Console, you can manage the log levels for JBI Components.
Some JBI Components provide several loggers while other components might not provide any.
However, there will always be a logger level displayed for the entire component.
But the logger level setting will only have an effect if a component
implements its loggers based on the default name. The provider of a JBI
Component might provide additional documentation on specifying logging levels. </p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The logging levels for JBI Components are often inherited from a parent logger
such as the JBI logger. To view and set parent logging levels, in
the Admin Console, select Common Tasks and then Application Server. Then, in the
Enterprise Server panel, select Logging and then Log Levels. Look for the drop-down
list for the JBI module to view and set the parent JBI
logging level.  </p>

<a name="gelqv"></a><h4>Service Assemblies</h4>
<p>A Service Assembly is a collection of Service Units that provision target components
that together provide or consume specific services for an application. Service Assemblies are
typically created in a development tools environment, such as that provided by NetBeans
Enterprise Pack. </p><p>A Service Assembly has the following lifecyle states:</p>
<ul><li><p> Started</p></li>
<li><p>Shutdown</p></li>
<li><p> Stopped</p></li></ul>
<p>The JBI Runtime persists the lifecycle states of Service Assemblies. When the Enterprise
Server shuts down and then restarts, Service Assemblies revert to their state at
the time the Enterprise Server shut down. </p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The JBI runtime attempts to revert to the "desired" state of a Service
Assembly. For example, suppose you tried to start a Service Assembly but it
did not start due to an error in the Service Assembly. If
you restart the Application Server, the JBI runtime attempts to start the Service
Assembly again.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can do the following operations on Service Assemblies. For detailed steps, log
on to the Admin Console, navigate to the JBI node, click Service Assemblies
and then click Online Help. </p>
<ul><li><p>View all the Service Assemblies, with support for sorting and for filtering by lifecycle state. </p></li>
<li><p>Deploy a Service Assembly. </p></li>
<li><p>Undeploy a Service Assembly.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage the lifecyle of a Service Assembly.</p></li>
<li><p>View the general properties of a Service Assembly. </p></li>
<li><p>View the descriptor for a Service Assembly. </p></li></ul>


<a name="geuwm"></a><h4>Shared Libraries</h4>
<p>A Shared Library provides Java classes that are not private to a
single component and is typically shared by more than one JBI Component. For
example, the Java EE Service Engine requires the WSDL Shared Library.</p><p>You can do the following operations on Shared Libraries. For detailed steps, log
on to the Admin Console, navigate to the JBI node, click Shared Libraries
and then click Online Help. </p>
<ul><li><p>View all Shared Libraries. </p></li>
<li><p>Install Shared Libraries. </p></li>
<li><p>View General Properties of a Shared Library. </p></li>
<li><p>View the descriptor for a Shared Library. </p></li>
<li><p>Uninstall a Shared Library. </p></li></ul>


<a name="geuxg"></a><h4>JBI Descriptors</h4>
<p>The descriptor file (<tt>jbi.xml</tt>) for Service Assemblies, JBI Components, and Shared Libraries provides
the following information:</p>
<ul><li><p>Service Assemblies: Lists the Service Units contained in the Service Assembly and the target for each Service Unit. Some Service Units may also show information on connection endpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>JBI Components: Lists the type of the JBI Component (Binding Component or Service Engine), a description of the component, information about relevant classpaths for the component, and the name of any Shared Library upon which it depends.</p></li>
<li><p>Shared Libraries: Lists the name of the shared library, and the names of the archive files (<tt>.jar</tt> files) or class file subdirectories it contains.</p></li></ul>
