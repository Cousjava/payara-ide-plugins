<a name="abluc"></a>Chapter&#160;16<h3>Thread Pools</h3><p><a name="indexterm-135"></a><a name="indexterm-136"></a><a name="indexterm-137"></a><a name="indexterm-138"></a><a name="indexterm-139"></a><a name="indexterm-140"></a><a name="indexterm-141"></a><a name="indexterm-142"></a><a name="indexterm-143"></a>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can support many threads of execution at once.
To help performance, the Enterprise Server maintains one or more thread pools. It
is possible to assign specific thread pools to connector modules and to the
ORB.</p><p>One thread pool can serve multiple connector modules and enterprise beans. Request threads
handle user requests for application components. When the server receives a request, it
assigns the request to a free thread from the thread pool. The thread
executes the client's requests and returns results. For example, if the request needs
to use a system resource that is currently busy, the thread waits until
that resource is free before allowing the request to use that resource.</p><p>Specify the minimum and maximum number of threads that are reserved for requests
from applications. The thread pool is dynamically adjusted between these two values. The
minimum thread pool size that is specified signals the server to allocate at
least that many threads in reserve for application requests. That number is increased
up to the maximum thread pool size that is specified.</p><p>Increasing the number of threads available to a process allows the process to
respond to more application requests simultaneously.</p><p><a name="indexterm-144"></a>Avoid thread starvation, where one resource adapter or application occupies all threads in
the Enterprise Server, by dividing the Enterprise Server threads into different thread-pools.</p><p>This chapter contains the following topics:</p>

<a name="ablud"></a><h3>Working with Thread Pools</h3>
<p>To create a thread pool using the Admin Console, go to Configuration >
Thread Pools > Current Pools > New.</p>
<ul><li><p>Enter the name of the thread pool in the Thread Pool ID field.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the minimum number of threads in the thread pool servicing requests in this queue in the Minimum Thread Pool Size field.</p><p>These threads are created up front when this thread pool is instantiated.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the maximum number of threads in the thread pool servicing requests in this queue in the Maximum Thread Pool Size field.</p><p>This is the upper limit on the number of threads that exist in the thread pool.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the number, in seconds, after which idle threads are removed from pool in the Idle Timeout field.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter the total number of work queues that are serviced by this thread pool in the Number of Work Queues field.</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the Enterprise Server.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more details on creating thread pools, click Help in the Admin
Console. </p><p>You can also create a thread pool from the command-line by using
the <tt>asadmin</tt> command, <tt>create-threadpool</tt>.</p><p>To edit a settings for a thread pool using the Admin Console,
go to Configuration > Thread Pools > Current Pools and select the pool
you want to configure. Modify the values for the selected thread pool, save
and restart the Enterprise Server.</p><p>For more details on editing thread pools, click Help in the Admin
Console.</p><p>To delete a thread pool using the Admin Console, go to Configuration >
Thread Pools > Current Pools. Check the thread pool name to be
deleted and click Delete.</p><p>You can also create a thread pool from the command-line by using
the <tt>asadmin</tt> command, <tt>delete-threadpool</tt>.</p>
