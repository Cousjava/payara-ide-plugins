<a name="ggktf"></a><h3>About Enterprise Server Security</h3>
<a name="indexterm-227"></a><a name="indexterm-228"></a><p>Security is about protecting data, that is, how to prevent unauthorized access or
damage to data that is in storage or in transit. The Enterprise
Server is built on the Java security model, which uses a sandbox where
applications can run safely, without potential risk to systems or users. <b>System security</b> affects
all the applications in the Enterprise Server environment. </p><p>System security features include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#ablnx">Authentication</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ghlvu">Authorization</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ghlql">Auditing</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ghlti">Firewalls</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#abloj">Certificates and SSL</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablnn">Application Security</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablno">Tools for Managing System Security</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="ablnx"></a><h4>Authentication</h4>
<a name="indexterm-229"></a><a name="indexterm-230"></a><p><b>Authentication</b> is the way in which an entity (a user, an application, or
a component) determines that another entity is who it claims to be. An
entity uses security <b>credentials</b> to authenticate itself. The credentials might be a user
name and password, a digital certificate, or something else. Usually, servers or applications
require clients to authenticate themselves. Additionally, clients might require servers to authenticate themselves. When
authentication is bidirectional, it is called <b>mutual authentication</b>.</p><p>When an entity tries to access a protected resource, Enterprise Server uses the
authentication mechanism configured for that resource to determine whether to grant access. For
example, a user can enter a user name and password in a web
browser, and if the application verifies those credentials, the user is authenticated. The
user is associated with this authenticated security identity for the remainder of the
session.</p>

<a name="ghsqc"></a><h5>Authentication Types</h5>
<p>Within its deployment descriptors, an application specifies the type of authentication that it
uses. Enterprise Server supports the following types of authentication:</p><dl><dt>BASIC</dt>
<dd><p>Uses the server's built-in login dialog box. The communication protocol is HTTP (SSL optional). There is no user-credentialed encryption unless using SSL.</p></dd>
<dt>FORM</dt>
<dd><p>The application provides its own custom login and error pages. The communication protocol is HTTP (SSL optional). There is no user-credentialed encryption unless using SSL.</p></dd>
<dt>CLIENT-CERT</dt>
<dd><p>The server authenticates the client using a public key certificate. The communication protocol is HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). User-credentialed encryption is SSL.</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="ghltx"></a><h5>Passwords</h5>
<a name="indexterm-231"></a><a name="indexterm-232"></a><p>Passwords are your first line of defense against unauthorized access to the components
and data of Enterprise Server. For information on how to use passwords for
Enterprise Server, see <a href="#ghgrp">Administering Passwords</a>.</p>

<a name="ghgof"></a><h5>Administration Password</h5>
<a name="indexterm-233"></a><a name="indexterm-234"></a><p>The administration password, also known as the admin password, is used to invoke
the Administration Console and the <tt>asadmin</tt> utility. This password is usually set during
installation, but it can be changed. For instructions, see <a href="#ghgpu">To Change the Administration Password</a>.</p>

<a name="ablnq"></a><h5>Encoded Passwords</h5>
<a name="indexterm-235"></a><p>Files that contain encoded passwords need to be protected using file system permissions.
These files include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p><i>domain-dir</i><tt>/master-password</tt></p><p>This file contains the encoded master password and should be protected with file system permissions 600.</p></li>
<li><p>Any password file created to pass as an argument by using the <tt>--passwordfile</tt> argument to the <tt>asadmin</tt> utility should be protected with file system permissions 600.</p></li></ul>
<p>For instructions, see <a href="#ghytn">To Set a Password From a File</a>.</p>

<a name="ghlus"></a><h5>Single Sign-on</h5>
<a name="indexterm-236"></a><a name="indexterm-237"></a><p>With <b>single sign-on</b>, a user who logs in to one application becomes implicitly logged
in to other applications that require the same authentication information. Single sign-on is
based on groups. All web applications whose deployment descriptor defines the same group
and uses the same authentication method (BASIC, FORM, or CLIENT-CERT) share single sign-on.</p><p>On Enterprise Server, single sign-on is enabled by default for virtual servers, allowing
multiple applications in one virtual server  to share the user authentication state.
</p>

<a name="ghlvu"></a><h4>Authorization</h4>
<a name="indexterm-238"></a><p><b>Authorization</b>, also known as access control, is the means by which users are
granted permission to access data or perform operations. After a user is authenticated,
the user's level of authorization determines what operations the owner can perform. A
user's authorization is based on the user's role. </p>

<a name="abloh"></a><h5>Roles</h5>
<a name="indexterm-239"></a><a name="indexterm-240"></a><p>A <b>role</b> defines which applications and what parts of each application users can
access and what those users or groups can do with the applications. For
example, in a personnel application, all employees might be able to see phone
numbers and email addresses, but only managers have access to salary information. This
application would define at least two roles: <tt>employee</tt> and <tt>manager</tt>. Only users in the
<tt>manager</tt> role are allowed to view salary information.</p><p>A role is different from a group in that a role defines
a function in an application, while a group is a set of users
who are related in some way. For example, the personnel application specify groups
such as <tt>full-time</tt>, <tt>part-time</tt>, and <tt>on-leave</tt>. Users in these groups are all employees
(the <tt>employee</tt> role). In addition, each user has its own designation that defines
an additional level of employment.</p><p>Roles are defined in the deployment descriptor for the application. The application developer
or deployer maps roles to one or more groups in the deployment descriptor
for each application. When the application is being packaged and deployed, the application
specifies mappings between users, groups, and roles, as illustrated in the following figure.</p><a name="fxjfw"></a><h6>Figure&#160;6-1 Role Mapping</h6><img src="figures/security-roleMapping.gif" alt="Figure shows how users are assigned to groups, how users and groups are assigned to roles, and how applications use groups and roles." width="440" height="228"></img>

<a name="ghsqd"></a><h5>Java Authorization Contract for Containers</h5>
<a name="indexterm-241"></a><a name="indexterm-242"></a><p>Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) is the part of the Java EE
specification that defines an interface for pluggable authorization providers. This enables you to
set up third-party plug-in modules to perform authorization. By default, the Enterprise Server
provides a simple, file-based authorization engine that complies with the JACC specification. You
can also specify additional third-party JACC providers. </p><p>JACC providers use the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) APIs. JAAS enables
services to authenticate and enforce access controls upon users. JAAS implements a Java
technology version of the standard Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) framework.</p>

<a name="ghlql"></a><h4>Auditing</h4>
<a name="indexterm-243"></a><p><b>Auditing</b> is the means used to capture security-related events for the purpose of
evaluating the effectiveness of security measures. Enterprise Server uses audit modules to capture
audit trails of all authentication and authorization decisions. Enterprise Server provides a default
audit module, as well as the ability to customize the audit modules. </p><p>For administration instructions, see <a href="#ghgol">Administering Audit Modules</a>.</p>

<a name="ghlti"></a><h4>Firewalls</h4>
<a name="indexterm-244"></a><p>A <b>firewall</b> controls the flow of data between two or more networks, and
manages the links between the networks. A firewall can consist of both hardware
and software elements. The following guidelines pertain primarily to Enterprise Server:</p>
<ul><li><p>In general, firewalls should be configured so that clients can access the necessary TCP/IP ports. </p><p>For example, if the HTTP listener is operating on port 8080, configure the firewall to allow HTTP requests on port 8080 only. Likewise, if HTTPS requests are set up for port 8181, you must configure the firewalls to allow HTTPS requests on port 8181.</p></li>
<li><p>In double firewall architecture, you must configure the outer firewall to allow for HTTP and HTTPS transactions. You must configure the inner firewall to allow the HTTP server plug-in to communicate with Enterprise Server behind the firewall.</p></li></ul>


<a name="abloj"></a><h4>Certificates and SSL</h4>
<a name="indexterm-245"></a><p>The following topics are addressed here:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#ablok">Certificates</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablol">Certificate Chains</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablqx">Certificate Files</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablom">Secure Sockets Layer</a></p></li></ul>
<p>For administration instructions, see <a href="#ablqz">Administering JSSE Certificates </a>.</p>

<a name="ablok"></a><h5>Certificates</h5>
<a name="indexterm-246"></a><p><b>Certificates</b>, also called digital certificates, are electronic files that uniquely identify people and
resources on the Internet. Certificates also enable secure, confidential communication between two entities. There
are different kinds of certificates:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Personal certificates</b> are used by individuals.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Server certificates</b> are used to establish secure sessions between the server and clients through secure sockets layer (SSL) technology.</p></li></ul>
<p>Certificates are based on <b>public key cryptography</b>, which uses pairs of digital keys (very long
numbers) to encrypt, or encode, information so the information can be read only
by its intended recipient. The recipient then decrypts (decodes) the information to read
it. A <b>key pair</b> contains a public key and a private key. The
owner distributes the public key and makes it available to anyone. But the
owner never distributes the private key, which is always kept secret. Because the
keys are mathematically related, data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted
with the other key in the pair.</p><p>Certificates are issued by a trusted third party called a <b>Certification Authority</b> (CA).
The CA is analogous to a passport office: it validates the certificate holder's
identity and signs the certificate so that it cannot be forged or tampered
with. After a CA has signed a certificate, the holder can present it
as proof of identity and to establish encrypted, confidential communications. Most importantly, a
certificate binds the owner's public key to the owner's identity.</p><p>In addition to the public key, a certificate typically includes information such as
the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>The name of the holder and other identification, such as the URL of the web server using the certificate, or an individual's email address</p></li>
<li><p>The name of the CA that issued the certificate</p></li>
<li><p>An expiration date</p></li></ul>
<p>Certificates are governed by the technical specifications of the X.509 format. To verify
the identity of a user in the <a name="indexterm-247"></a><tt>certificate</tt> realm, the authentication service verifies
an X.509 certificate, using the common name field of the X.509 certificate as
the principal name.</p>

<a name="ablol"></a><h5>Certificate Chains</h5>
<p>A <b>certificate chain</b> is a series of certificates issued by successive CA certificates, eventually
ending in a root CA certificate.</p><p>Web browsers are preconfigured with a set of root CA certificates that the
browser automatically trusts. Any certificates from elsewhere must come with a certificate chain
to verify their validity. </p>

<a name="ablqx"></a><h5>Certificate Files</h5>
<a name="indexterm-248"></a><a name="indexterm-249"></a><a name="indexterm-250"></a><a name="indexterm-251"></a><a name="indexterm-252"></a><p>During Enterprise Server installation, a certificate is generated in Java Secure Socket Extension
(JSSE)  format suitable for internal testing. By default, Enterprise Server stores its
certificate information in certificate databases in the <i>domain-dir</i><tt>/config</tt> directory:</p><dl><dt>Keystore file</dt>
<dd><p>The <tt>key3.db</tt> file contains Enterprise Server certificate, including its private key. The keystore file is protected with a password.</p><p>Each keystore entry has a unique alias. After installation, the Enterprise Server keystore has a single entry with an alias of <tt>s1as</tt>.</p></dd>
<dt>Truststore file</dt>
<dd><p>The <tt>cert8.db</tt> file contains the Enterprise Server trusted certificates, including public keys for other entities. For a trusted certificate, the server has confirmed that the public key in the certificate belongs to the certificate's owner. Trusted certificates generally include those of CAs.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>By default, Enterprise Server is configured with a keystore and truststore that will
work with the example applications and for development purposes. </p>

<a name="ablom"></a><h5>Secure Sockets Layer</h5>
<a name="indexterm-253"></a><p><b>Secure Sockets Layer</b> (SSL) is the most popular standard for securing Internet communications and transactions.
Secure web applications use HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). The HTTPS protocol uses certificates to
ensure confidential and secure communications between server and clients. In an SSL connection,
both the client and the server encrypt data before sending it. Data is
decrypted upon receipt.</p><p>The newest version of the SSL standard is called Transport Layer Security (TLS).
The Enterprise Server supports the SSL 3.0 and the TLS 1.0 encryption
protocols.</p><p>To use SSL, Enterprise Server must have a certificate for each external interface
or IP address that accepts secure connections. The HTTPS service of most web
servers will not run unless a certificate has been installed.</p>

<a name="ablon"></a><h5>Ciphers</h5>
<p>A <b>cipher</b> is a cryptographic algorithm used for encryption or decryption. SSL and
TLS protocols support a variety of ciphers used to authenticate the server and
client to each other, transmit certificates, and establish session keys.</p><p>Some ciphers are stronger and more secure than others. Clients and servers can
support different cipher suites. During a secure connection, the client and the server
agree to use the strongest cipher that they both have enabled for communication,
so it is usually sufficient to enable all ciphers.</p>

<a name="ablnn"></a><h4>Application Security</h4>
<a name="indexterm-254"></a><p>Unlike system security, which affects all the applications on Enterprise Server, <b>Application security</b>
affects a particular application. There are basically two types of application security: programmatic
and declarative. </p>
<ul><li><p>In declarative security, Enterprise Server container handles security through an application's deployment descriptors. You can control declarative security by editing deployment descriptors directly. Because deployment descriptors can change after an application is developed, declarative security allows for more flexibility. </p></li>
<li><p>In programmatic security, application code handles security chores. Generally, programmatic security is discouraged since security configurations are hard coded in the application instead of being managed through the Java EE containers. Programmatic security is controlled by the application developer. </p></li></ul>
<p>Information on application security is contained in the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-4496/beabg?a=view">Chapter 4, Securing Applications, in <i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Prelude Developer&#8217;s Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="ablno"></a><h4>Tools for Managing System Security</h4>
<a name="indexterm-255"></a><a name="indexterm-256"></a><p>Enterprise Server provides the following tools for managing system security:</p><dl><dt>Administration Console</dt>
<dd><p> The Administration Console is a browser-based utility used to configure security for the entire server. Tasks include managing certificates, users, groups, and realms, and performing other system-wide security tasks. For a general introduction to the Administration Console, see <a href="p4.html#ablav">Administration Console</a>.</p></dd>
<dt>The <tt>asadmin</tt> utility</dt>
<dd><p>The <tt>asadmin</tt> command-line utility performs many of the same tasks as the Administration Console. You might be able to do some things with the <tt>asadmin</tt> utility that you cannot do with the Administration Console. For a general introduction to <tt>asadmin</tt>, see <a href="p4.html#gcocs">Command-Line Utility for Administration (<tt>asadmin</tt>)</a>.</p></dd>
<dt>The <tt>keytool</tt> utility</dt>
<dd><p>The <tt>keytool</tt> Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) command-line utility is used for managing digital certificates and key pairs. For more information, see <a href="#ablqz">Administering JSSE Certificates </a>.</p></dd>
<dt>The <tt>policytool</tt> utility</dt>
<dd><p>The <tt>policytool</tt> J2SE graphical utility is used for managing system-wide Java security policies. As an administrator, you rarely use <tt>policytool</tt>.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>For more information on using <tt>keytool</tt>, <tt>policytool</tt>, and other Java security tools,
see<i> Java 2 SDK Tools and Utilities</i> at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/tools.html#security">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/tools.html#security</a>.</p>

<a name="ghgrp"></a><h3>Administering Passwords</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to administer passwords. You can rely on administrators to
keep passwords secret and change the passwords regularly. You can set up files
for storing passwords so that <tt>asadmin</tt> commands can access these files rather than
having users type the commands. </p><p>The following topics are addressed here:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#ghgpu">To Change the Administration Password</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ghytn">To Set a Password From a File</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="ghgpu"></a><h4>To Change the Administration Password</h4><a name="indexterm-257"></a><a name="indexterm-258"></a><a name="indexterm-259"></a><p>The remote <tt>change-admin-password</tt> command allows you to change the administration password. You are
prompted for the old and new admin passwords, with confirmation.</p><ol>
<li><b>Ensure that the server is running. </b><p>Remote commands require a running server.</p></li>
<li><b>Change the admin password by using the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-4497/change-admin-password-1?a=view"><tt>change-admin-password</tt>(1)</a> command. </b></li>
<li><b>Enter the old and new admin password as prompted.</b></li></ol><a name="ghlac"></a><h6>Example&#160;6-1 Changing the Admin Password</h6><p>The following example changes the admin password for user anonymous from <tt>adminadmin</tt> to
<tt>newadmin</tt>:</p><pre><tt><b>asadmin change-admin-password --user anonymous</b></tt></pre><p>Information similar to the following is displayed:</p><pre>Enter admin password>adminadmin
Enter new admin password>newadmin
Enter new admin password again>newadmin
Command change-admin-password executed successfully.</pre><h6>See Also</h6><p>To see the full syntax and options of the command, type <tt>asadmin change-admin-password <tt>--help</tt></tt>
at the command line.</p>

<a name="ghytn"></a><h4>To Set a Password From a File</h4><a name="indexterm-260"></a><a name="indexterm-261"></a><a name="indexterm-262"></a><p>Instead of typing the password at the command line, you can access
the password for a command from a file such as <tt>passwords.txt</tt>. The <tt>--passwordfile</tt> option
of the <tt>asadmin</tt> utility takes the name of the file that contains
the passwords. The entry for a password in the file must have the
<tt>AS_ADMIN_</tt> prefix followed by the password name in uppercase letters. </p><p>The following other types of passwords can be specified: </p><pre>AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD
AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD
AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD</pre><ol>
<li><b>Edit the password file.</b><p>For example, to specify the password for the domain administration server (DAS), add
an entry similar to the following to the password file, where <tt>adminadmin</tt> is the
administrator password:</p><pre>AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminadmin </pre></li>
<li><b>Save the password file.</b></li>
<li><b>Specify the password file in an <tt>asadmin</tt> command.</b><p>For example:</p><pre>asadmin delete-jdbc-resource --user admin --password passwords.file jdbc/DerbyPool</pre></li></ol><h6>Troubleshooting</h6><p>If <tt>AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD</tt> has been exported to the global environment, specifying the <tt>--passwordfile</tt> option will
produce a warning about using the <tt>--passwordfile</tt> option. To prevent this warning situation
from happening, unset <tt>AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD</tt>. </p>

E-commerce sites, or those for which authentication of identity is important, can purchase
a certificate from a well-known Certificate Authority (CA). </p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If authentication is not a concern, for example if private secure communications are
all that is required, you can save the time and expense involved in
obtaining a CA certificate by using a self-signed certificate.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><b>Follow the instructions on the CA's web site for generating certificate key pairs.</b></li>
<li><b>Download the generated certificate key pair.</b><p>Save the certificate in the directory containing the keystore and truststore files. The default
is <i>domain-dir</i><tt>/config</tt>.</p></li>
<li><b>In your shell, change to the directory containing the certificate.</b></li>
<li><b>Import the certificate into the local keystore and, if necessary, the local truststore
