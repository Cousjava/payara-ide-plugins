<!-- Pass by Reference semantics:  EJB spec requires pass by value,
     which will be the default mode of operation. This can be set 
     to true for non-compliant and possibly higher performance. 
     For a stand-alone, this can be set at this level. By setting 
     a similarly named element at sun-application, it can apply to 
     all the enclosed ejb modules. Allowed values are true and 
     false. Default will be false.
