<a name="bealk"></a>Chapter&#160;12<h3>Developing Connectors</h3><a name="indexterm-680"></a><a name="indexterm-681"></a><a name="indexterm-682"></a><p>This chapter describes Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server support for the Java<sup>TM</sup> EE 1.6
Connector Architecture, also known as <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=322">JSR 322</a>.</p><p>The Java EE Connector Architecture provides a Java solution to the problem of
connectivity between multiple application servers and existing enterprise information systems (EISs). By using
the Java EE Connector architecture, EIS vendors no longer need to customize their
product for each application server. Application server vendors who conform to the Java EE Connector
architecture do not need to write custom code to add connectivity to a
new EIS.</p><p><a name="indexterm-683"></a>This chapter uses the terms <b>connector</b> and <b>resource adapter</b> interchangeably. Both terms refer
to a resource adapter module that is developed in conformance with the Java EE Connector
Specification.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If you installed the Web Profile, connector modules that use only outbound communication features
and work-management that does not involve inbound communication features are supported. Other connector
features are supported only in the full Enterprise Server.</p>

<a name="beall"></a><h3>Connector Support in the Enterprise Server</h3>
<a name="indexterm-684"></a><p>The Enterprise Server supports the development and deployment of resource adapters that are
compatible with the Connector 1.6 specification (and, for backward compatibility, the Connector 1.0
and 1.5 specifications).</p><p>The Connector 1.0 specification defines the outbound connectivity system contracts between the resource
adapter and the Enterprise Server. The Connector 1.5 specification introduces major additions in
defining system level contracts between the Enterprise Server and the resource adapter with respect
to inbound connectivity, life cycle management, and thread management. The Connector 1.6 specification
introduces further additions in defining system level contracts between the Enterprise Server and the
resource adapter with respect to the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Generic work context contract &#8212; A generic contract that enables a resource adapter to control the execution context of a <tt>Work</tt> instance that it has submitted to the Enterprise Server for execution. The <tt>Generic</tt> work contract provides the mechanism for a resource adapter to augment the runtime context of a <tt>Work</tt> instance with additional contextual information flown-in from the EIS. This contract enables a resource adapter to control, in a more flexible manner, the contexts in which the <tt>Work</tt> instances submitted by it are executed by the application server's <tt>WorkManager</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Security work context &#8212; A standard contract that enables a resource adapter to establish security information while submitting a <tt>Work</tt> instance for execution to a <tt>WorkManager</tt> and while delivering messages-to-message endpoints residing in the Enterprise Server. This contract provides a mechanism to support the execution of a <tt>Work</tt> instance in the context of an established identity. It also supports the propagation of user information or Principal information from an EIS to a <tt>MessageEndpoint</tt> during message inflow.</p></li></ul>


<a name="bealm"></a><h4>Connector Architecture for JMS and JDBC</h4>
<a name="indexterm-685"></a><a name="indexterm-686"></a><p>In the Administration Console, connector, JMS, and JDBC resources are handled differently, but
they use the same underlying Connector architecture. In the Enterprise Server, all communication
to an EIS, whether to a message provider or an RDBMS, happens through
the Connector architecture. To provide JMS infrastructure to clients, the Enterprise Server uses
the Sun GlassFish Message Queue software. To provide JDBC infrastructure to clients, the
Enterprise Server uses its own JDBC system resource adapters. The application server automatically makes
these system resource adapters available to any client that requires them.</p><p>For more information about JMS in the Enterprise Server, see <a href="p23.html">Chapter&#160;17, Using the Java Message Service</a>. For more
information about JDBC in the Enterprise Server, see <a href="p20.html">Chapter&#160;14, Using the JDBC API for Database Access</a>.</p>

<a name="bealn"></a><h4>Connector Configuration</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-687"></a><a name="indexterm-688"></a>The Enterprise Server does not need to use <tt>sun-ra.xml</tt>, which previous Enterprise Server
versions used, to store server-specific deployment information inside a Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) file.
(However, the <tt>sun-ra.xml</tt> file is still supported for backward compatibility.) Instead, the information is
stored in the server configuration. As a result, you can create multiple connector
connection pools for a connection definition in a functional resource adapter instance, and
you can create multiple user-accessible connector resources (that is, registering a resource with a
JNDI name) for a connector connection pool. In addition, dynamic changes can be
made to connector connection pools and the connector resource properties without restarting the
Enterprise Server.</p>

<a name="bealr"></a><h3>Advanced Connector Configuration Options</h3>
<a name="indexterm-689"></a><p>You can use these advanced connector configuration options:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#beals">Thread Associations</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#bealt">Security Maps</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#giqgt">Work Security Maps</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="#gizba">Disabling Pooling for a Connection</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gizcs">Using Application-Scoped Connectors</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="beals"></a><h4>Thread Associations</h4>
<a name="indexterm-690"></a><a name="indexterm-691"></a><p>Connectors can submit work instances to the Enterprise Server for execution. By default,
the Enterprise Server services work requests for all connectors from its default thread
pool. However, you can associate a specific user-created thread pool to service work
requests from a connector. A thread pool can service work requests from multiple resource
adapters. To create a thread pool:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-692"></a>In the Administration Console, select Thread Pools under the relevant configuration. For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-693"></a><a name="indexterm-694"></a>Use the <tt>asadmin create-threadpool</tt> command. For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>To associate a connector with a thread pool:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-695"></a>In the Administration Console, open the Applications component and select Connector Modules. Deploy the module, or select the previously deployed module. Specify the name of the thread pool in the Thread Pool ID field. For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-696"></a><a name="indexterm-697"></a>Use the <tt>--threadpoolid</tt> option of the <tt>asadmin create-resource-adapter-config</tt> command. For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>If you create a resource adapter configuration for a connector module that is
already deployed, the connector module deployment is restarted with the new configuration properties.</p>

<a name="bealt"></a><h4>Security Maps</h4>
<a name="indexterm-698"></a><p>Create a security map for a connector connection pool to map an application
principal or a user group to a back end EIS principal. The security
map is usually used in situations where one or more EIS back end
principals are used to execute operations (on the EIS) initiated by various principals
or user groups in the application.</p><p>To create or update security maps for a connector connection pool:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-699"></a>In the Administration Console, open the Resources component, select Connectors, select Connector Connection Pools, and select the Security Maps tab. For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-700"></a><a name="indexterm-701"></a>Use the <tt>asadmin create-connector-security-map</tt> command. For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>If a security map already exists for a connector connection pool, the new
security map is appended to the previous one. The connector security map configuration
supports the use of the wildcard asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) to indicate all users or
all user groups.</p><p>When an application principal initiates a request to an EIS, the Enterprise Server
first checks for an exact match to a mapped back end EIS principal
using the security map defined for the connector connection pool. If there is
no exact match, the Enterprise Server uses the wild card character specification, if
any, to determined the mapped back end EIS principal.</p>

<a name="giqgt"></a><h4>Work Security Maps</h4>
<p>A work security map for a resource adapter maps an EIS principal or
group to a application principal or group. A work security map is useful
in situations where one or more application principals execute operations initiated by principals
or user groups in the EIS. A resource adapter can have multiple work
security maps. A work security map can map either principals or groups, but
not both.</p><p>To create a work security map, use the <tt>asadmin create-connector-work-security-map</tt> command. For details,
see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p><p>The work security map configuration supports the wildcard asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) character to indicate
all users or all user groups. When an EIS principal sends a request
to the Enterprise Server, the Enterprise Server first checks for an exact match
to a mapped application principal using the work security map defined for the
resource adapter. If there is no exact match, the Enterprise Server uses the
wild card character specification, if any, to determine the application principal.</p>

<a name="bealu"></a><h4>Overriding Configuration Properties</h4>
<a name="indexterm-702"></a><a name="indexterm-703"></a><p>You can override the properties (<tt>config-property</tt> elements) specified in the <tt>ra.xml</tt> file of
a resource adapter. Use the <tt>asadmin create-resource-adapter-config</tt> command to create a configuration for a resource
adapter. Use this command&#8217;s <tt>--property</tt> option to specify a name-value pair for
a resource adapter property.</p><p>You can use the <tt>asadmin create-resource-adapter-config</tt> command either before or after resource adapter deployment.
If it is executed after deploying the resource adapter, the existing resource adapter is
restarted with the new properties. For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p>

<a name="bealv"></a><h4>Testing a Connector Connection Pool</h4>
<a name="indexterm-704"></a><p>You can test a connector connection pool for usability in one of these
ways:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-705"></a>In the Administration Console, open the Resources component, open the Connector component, select Connection Pools, and select the connection pool you want to test. Then select the Ping button in the top right corner of the page. For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-706"></a><a name="indexterm-707"></a>Use the <tt>asadmin ping-connection-pool</tt> command. For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>Both these commands fail and display an error message unless they successfully connect
to the connection pool.</p><p>You can also specify that a connection pool is automatically tested when created
or reconfigured by setting the Ping attribute to <tt>true</tt> (the default is
<tt>false</tt>) in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-708"></a>Enter a Ping value in the Connector Connection Pools page in the Administration Console. For more information, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-709"></a><a name="indexterm-710"></a>Specify the <tt>--ping</tt> option in the <tt>asadmin create-connector-connection-pool</tt> command. For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gizcv"></a><h4>Flushing a Connector Connection Pool</h4>
<a name="indexterm-711"></a><p>Flushing a connector connection pool recreates all the connections in the pool and
brings the pool to the steady pool size without the need for reconfiguring
the pool. Connection pool reconfiguration can result in application redeployment, which is a
time-consuming operation. Flushing destroys existing connections, and any existing transactions are lost and must
be retired.</p><p>You can flush a connector connection pool in one of these ways:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-712"></a>In the Administration Console, open the Resources component, open the Connector component, select Connection Pools, and select the connection pool you want to flush. Then select the Flush button in the top right corner of the page. For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-713"></a><a name="indexterm-714"></a>Use the <tt>asadmin flush-connection-pool</tt> command. For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>


<a name="bealw"></a><h4>Handling Invalid Connections</h4>
<a name="indexterm-715"></a><a name="indexterm-716"></a><a name="indexterm-717"></a><a name="indexterm-718"></a><p>If a resource adapter generates a <tt>ConnectionErrorOccured</tt> event, the Enterprise Server considers the
connection invalid and removes the connection from the connection pool. Typically, a resource
adapter generates a <tt>ConnectionErrorOccured</tt> event when it finds a <tt>ManagedConnection</tt> object unusable. Reasons can be
network failure with the EIS, EIS failure, fatal problems with the resource adapter,
and so on. </p><p>If the <tt>fail-all-connections</tt> setting in the connection pool configuration is set to <tt>true</tt>, and
a single connection fails, all connections are closed and recreated. If this setting
is <tt>false</tt>, individual connections are recreated only when they are used. The default
is <tt>false</tt>.</p><p>The <tt>is-connection-validation-required</tt> setting specifies whether connections have to be validated before being given to
the application. If a resource&#8217;s validation fails, it is destroyed, and a new
resource is created and returned. The default is <tt>false</tt>.</p><p>The <tt>PreferValidateOverRecreate</tt> property specifies that validating idle connections is preferable to closing them.
This property has no effect on non-idle connections. If set to <tt>true</tt>, idle
connections are validated during pool resizing, and only those found to be invalid are
destroyed and recreated. If <tt>false</tt>, all idle connections are destroyed and recreated during
pool resizing. The default is <tt>false</tt>.</p><p>You can set the <tt>fail-all-connections</tt>, <tt>is-connection-validation-required</tt>, and <tt>PreferValidateOverRecreate</tt> configuration settings during creation of
a connector connection pool. Or, you can use the <tt>asadmin set</tt> command to
dynamically reconfigure a setting. For example:</p><pre>asadmin set server.resources.connector-connection-pool.CCPool1.fail-all-connections="true"
asadmin set server.resources.connector-connection-pool.CCPool1.is-connection-validation-required="true"
asadmin set server.resources.connector-connection-pool.CCPool1.property.PreferValidateOverRecreate="true"</pre><p>For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p><p>The interface <tt>ValidatingManagedConnectionFactory</tt> exposes the method <tt>getInvalidConnections</tt> to allow retrieval of the invalid connections.
The Enterprise Server checks if the resource adapter implements this interface, and if
it does, invalid connections are removed when the connection pool is resized.</p>

<a name="bealx"></a><h4>Setting the Shutdown Timeout</h4>
<a name="indexterm-719"></a><p>According to the Connector specification, while an application server shuts down, all resource
adapters should be stopped. A resource adapter might hang during shutdown, since shutdown
is typically a resource intensive operation. To avoid such a situation, you can
set a timeout that aborts resource adapter shutdown if exceeded. The default timeout is
30 seconds per resource adapter module. To configure this timeout:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-720"></a>In the Administration Console, select Connector Service under the relevant configuration and edit the shutdown Timeout field. For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the following command:</p><pre>asadmin set server.connector-service.shutdown-timeout-in-seconds="<i>num-secs</i>"</pre><p>For details, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>The Enterprise Server deactivates all message-driven bean deployments before stopping a resource adapter.</p>

<a name="bealy"></a><h4>Using Last Agent Optimization of Transactions</h4>
<a name="indexterm-721"></a><a name="indexterm-722"></a><p>Transactions that involve multiple resources or multiple participant processes are <b>distributed</b> or <b>global</b>
transactions. A global transaction can involve one non-XA resource if last agent optimization is
enabled. Otherwise, all resources must be XA. For more information about transactions in
the Enterprise Server, see <a href="p21.html">Chapter&#160;15, Using the Transaction Service</a>.</p><p>The Connector specification requires that if a resource adapter supports <tt>XATransaction</tt>, the <tt>ManagedConnection</tt>
created from that resource adapter must support both distributed and local transactions. Therefore,
even if a resource adapter supports <tt>XATransaction</tt>, you can configure its connector
connection pools as non-XA or without transaction support for better performance. A non-XA resource
adapter becomes the last agent in the transactions in which it participates.</p><p><a name="indexterm-723"></a>The value of the connection pool configuration property <tt>transaction-support</tt> defaults to the
value of the <tt>transaction-support</tt> property in the <tt>ra.xml</tt> file. The connection pool configuration
property can override the <tt>ra.xml</tt> file property if the transaction level in the
connection pool configuration property is lower. If the value in the connection pool
configuration property is higher, it is ignored.</p>

<a name="gizba"></a><h4>Disabling Pooling for a Connection</h4>
<p>To disable connection pooling, set the Pooling attribute to false. The default is
true. You can enable or disable connection pooling in one of the following
ways:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-724"></a>Enter a Pooling value in the Connector Connection Pools page in the Administration Console. For more information, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-725"></a><a name="indexterm-726"></a>Specify the <tt>--pooling</tt> option in the <tt>asadmin create-connector-connection-pool</tt> command. For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7701"><i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Reference Manual</i></a>.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gizcs"></a><h4>Using Application-Scoped Connectors</h4>
<a name="indexterm-727"></a><a name="indexterm-728"></a><p>You can define an application-scoped connector or other resource for an enterprise application,
web module, EJB module, connector module, or application client module by supplying a
<tt>sun-resources.xml</tt> deployment descriptor file. For details, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-7693/giydj?a=view">Application-Scoped Resources in <i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Preview Application Deployment Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="bealz"></a><h3>Inbound Communication Support</h3>
<a name="indexterm-729"></a><a name="indexterm-730"></a><p>The Connector specification defines the transaction and message inflow system contracts for achieving
inbound connectivity from an EIS. The message inflow contract also serves as a
standard message provider pluggability contract, thereby allowing various message providers to seamlessly plug in
their products with any application server that supports the message inflow contract. In
the inbound communication model, the EIS initiates all communication to an application. An
application can be composed of enterprise beans (session, entity, or message-driven beans), which reside
in an EJB container.</p><p>Incoming messages are received through a message endpoint, which is a message-driven bean.
This message-driven bean asynchronously consumes messages from a message provider. An application can
also synchronously send and receive messages directly using messaging style APIs.</p><p>A resource adapter supporting inbound communication provides an instance of an <tt>ActivationSpec</tt> JavaBean
class for each supported message listener type. Each class contains a set of configurable
properties that specify endpoint activation configuration information during message-driven bean deployment. The required
<tt>config-property</tt> element in the <tt>ra.xml</tt> file provides a list of configuration property names
required for each activation specification. An endpoint activation fails if the required property values
are not specified. Values for the properties that are overridden in the message-driven
bean&#8217;s deployment descriptor are applied to the <tt>ActivationSpec</tt> JavaBean when the message-driven bean is
deployed.</p><p>Administered objects can also be specified for a resource adapter, and these JavaBeans
are specific to a messaging style or message provider. For example, some messaging
styles may need applications to use special administered objects (such as <tt>Queue</tt> and
<tt>Topic</tt> objects in JMS). Applications use these objects to send and synchronously receive
messages using connection objects using messaging style APIs. For more information about administered
objects, see <a href="p23.html">Chapter&#160;17, Using the Java Message Service</a>.</p>

<a name="gizdm"></a><h3>Outbound Communication Support</h3>
<a name="indexterm-731"></a><a name="indexterm-732"></a><p>The Connector specification defines the system contracts for achieving outbound connectivity from an
EIS. A resource adapter supporting outbound communication provides an instance of a <tt>ManagedConnectionFactory</tt>
JavaBean class. A <tt>ManagedConnectionFactory</tt> JavaBean represents outbound connectivity information to an EIS instance
from an application.</p><p>The 1.6 Connector specification introduces a mechanism through which the transaction level of
a <tt>ManagedConnectionFactory</tt> can be detected at runtime. During the configuration of a <tt>ManagedConnectionFactory</tt>
in the Connector Connection Pools page in the Administration Console, the Administration Console
can instantiate the <tt>ManagedConnectionFactory</tt> and show the level of transaction support. The three
levels are <tt>no-tx</tt>, <tt>local-tx</tt>, <tt>xa-tx</tt>. If a <tt>ManagedConnectionFactory</tt> returns <tt>local-tx</tt> as the level
it can support, it is assumed that <tt>xa-tx</tt> is not supported, and
the Administration Console shows only <tt>no-tx</tt> and <tt>local-tx</tt> as the available support levels.</p><p>For more information, click the Help button in the Administration Console.</p>

<a name="beama"></a><h3>Configuring a Message Driven Bean to Use a Resource Adapter</h3>
<a name="indexterm-733"></a><a name="indexterm-734"></a><p>The Connectors specification&#8217;s message inflow contract provides a generic mechanism to plug in
a wide-range of message providers, including JMS, into a Java-EE-compatible application server. Message providers
use a resource adapter and dispatch messages to message endpoints, which are implemented
as message-driven beans.</p><p>The message-driven bean developer provides activation configuration information in the message-driven bean&#8217;s <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt>
file. Configuration information includes messaging-style-specific configuration details, and possibly message-provider-specific details as well. The message-driven
bean deployer uses this configuration information to set up the activation specification JavaBean.
The activation configuration properties specified in <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> override configuration properties in the activation specification
definition in the <tt>ra.xml</tt> file.</p><p>According to the EJB specification, the messaging-style-specific descriptor elements contained within the activation
configuration element are not specified because they are specific to a messaging provider. In
the following sample message-driven bean <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt>, a message-driven bean has the following
activation configuration property names: <tt>destinationType</tt>, <tt>SubscriptionDurability</tt>, and <tt>MessageSelector</tt>.</p><pre>&#60;!--  A sample MDB that listens to a JMS Topic -->

to associate the resource adapter with a message endpoint through the message inflow contract.
This message inflow contract with the application server gives the resource adapter a
handle to the <tt>MessageEndpointFactory</tt> and the <tt>ActivationSpec</tt> JavaBean, and the adapter uses this
handle to deliver messages to the message endpoint instances (which are created by
the <tt>MessageEndpointFactory</tt>).</p><p>When a message-driven bean first created for use on the Enterprise Server
7 is deployed, the Connector runtime transparently transforms the previous deployment style to the
current connector-based deployment style. If the deployer specifies neither a <tt>resource-adapter-mid</tt> property nor the
Message Queue resource adapter&#8217;s activation configuration properties, the Connector runtime maps the message-driven
bean to the <tt>jmsra</tt> system resource adapter and converts the JMS-specific configuration to the
Message Queue resource adapter&#8217;s activation configuration properties.</p>
