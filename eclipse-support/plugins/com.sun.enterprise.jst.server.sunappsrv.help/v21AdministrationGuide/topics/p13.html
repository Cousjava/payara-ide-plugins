and web services concepts. This chapter describes the configuration of message layer security
for web services in the Enterprise Server. This chapter contains the following topics:</p>

<a name="ablrm"></a><h3>Overview of Message Security</h3>
<p>In <b>message security</b>, security information is inserted into messages so that it travels through
the networking layers and arrives with the message at the message destination(s). Message
security differs from transport layer security (which is discussed in the<i> Security</i> chapter of the<i> Java EE 5.0 Tutorial</i>)
in that message security can be used to decouple message protection from message
transport so that messages remain protected after transmission.</p><p>Web Services Security: SOAP Message Security (WS-Security) is an international standard for interoperable
Web Services Security that was developed in OASIS by a collaboration of all
the major providers of web services technology (including Sun Microsystems). WS-Security is a
message security mechanism that uses XML Encryption and XML Digital Signature to secure
web services messages sent over SOAP. The WS-Security specification defines the use of
various security tokens including X.509 certificates, SAML assertions, and username/password tokens to authenticate and
encrypt SOAP web services messages.</p><p>The WS-Security specification can be viewed at <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf">http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf</a>.</p>

<a name="ablrn"></a><h3>Understanding Message Security in the Enterprise Server</h3>
<p>The Enterprise Server offers integrated support for the WS-Security standard in its web
services client and server-side containers. This functionality is integrated such that web services
security is enforced by the containers of the Enterprise Server on behalf of
applications, and such that it can be applied to protect any web service
application without requiring changes to the implementation of the application. The Enterprise Server
achieves this effect by providing facilities to bind SOAP layer message security providers
and message protection policies to containers and to applications deployed in containers.</p>

<a name="ablro"></a><h4>Assigning Message Security Responsibilities</h4>
<p>In the Enterprise Server, the <a href="#ablrp">System Administrator</a> and <a href="#ablrq">Application Deployer</a> roles are expected to
take primary responsibility for configuring message security. In some situations, the <a href="#ablrr">Application Developer</a> may also
contribute, although in the typical case either of the other roles may secure
an existing application without changing its implementation without involving the developer. The responsibilities of
the various roles are defined in the following sections:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#ablrp">System Administrator</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablrq">Application Deployer</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablrr">Application Developer</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="ablrp"></a><h5>System Administrator</h5>
<p>The system administrator is responsible for:</p>
<ul><li><p>Configuring message security providers on the Enterprise Server.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing user databases.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing keystore and truststore files.</p></li>
<li><p>Configuring a Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provider if using encryption and running a version of the Java SDK prior to version 1.5.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Installing the samples server. This is only done if the <tt>xms</tt> sample application will be used to demonstrate the use of message layer web services security.</p></li></ul>
<p>A system administrator uses the Admin Console to manage server security settings and
uses a command line tool to manage certificate databases. In Platform Edition, certificates
and private keys are stored in key stores and are managed with <tt>keytool</tt>.
Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition store certificates and private keys in an NSS
database, where they are managed using <tt>certutil</tt>. This document is intended primarily for system
administrators. For an overview of message security tasks, see <a href="#ablsb">Configuring the Enterprise Server for Message Security</a>.</p>

<a name="ablrq"></a><h5>Application Deployer</h5>
<p>The application deployer is responsible for:</p>
<ul><li><p>Specifying (at application assembly) any required application-specific message protection policies if such policies have not already been specified by upstream roles (the developer or assembler).</p></li>
<li><p>Modifying Sun-specific deployment descriptors to specify application-specific message protection policies information (message-security-binding elements) to web service endpoint and service references.</p></li></ul>


<a name="ablrr"></a><h5>Application Developer</h5>
<p>The application developer can turn on message security, but is not responsible for
doing so. Message security can be set up by the System Administrator
so that all web services are secured, or by the Application Deployer when
the provider or protection policy bound to the application must be different from that
bound to the container.</p><p>The application developer or assembler is responsible for the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Determining if an application-specific message protection policy is required by the application. If so, ensuring that the required policy is specified at application assembly which may be accomplished by communicating with the Application Deployer.</p></li></ul>


<a name="ablrs"></a><h4>About Security Tokens and Security Mechanisms</h4>
<p>The WS-Security specification provides an extensible mechanism for using security tokens to authenticate
and encrypt SOAP web services messages. The SOAP layer message security providers installed
with the Enterprise Server may be used to employ username/password and X.509 certificate
security tokens to authenticate and encrypt SOAP web services messages. Additional providers that employ
other security tokens including SAML assertions will be installed with subsequent releases of
the Enterprise Server.</p>

<a name="ablrt"></a><h5>About Username Tokens</h5>
<p>The Enterprise Server uses <b>Username tokens</b> in SOAP messages to establish the authentication identity
of the message <b>sender</b>. The recipient of a message containing a Username
token (within embedded password) validates that the message sender is authorized to act as
the user (identified in the token) by confirming that the sender knows the
secret (the password) of the user.</p><p>When using a Username token, a valid user database must be configured on
the Enterprise Server</p>

<a name="ablru"></a><h5>About Digital Signatures</h5>
<p>The Enterprise Server uses XML Digital signatures to bind an authentication identity to
message <b>content</b>. Clients use digital signatures to establish their caller identity, analogous to
the way basic authentication or SSL client certificate authentication have been used to
do the same thing when transport layer security is being used. Digital signatures
are verified by the message receiver to authenticate the source of the message
content (which may be different from the sender of the message.)</p><p>When using digital signatures, valid keystore and truststore files must be configured on
the Enterprise Server. For more information on this topic, read <a href="p12.html#ablqx">About Certificate Files</a>.</p>

<a name="ablrv"></a><h5>About Encryption</h5>
<p>The purpose of encryption is to modify the data such that it
can only be understood by its intended audience. This is accomplished by substituting an
encrypted element for the original content. When predicated on public key cryptography, encryption
can be used to establish the identity of the parties that can read
a message.</p><p>When using Encryption, you must have an installed JCE provider that supports encryption.
For more information on this topic, read <a href="#gdhbe">Configuring a JCE Provider</a>.</p>

<a name="ablrw"></a><h5>About Message Protection Policies</h5>
<p>Message protection policies are defined for request message processing and response message processing
and are expressed in terms of requirements for source and/or recipient authentication. A
source authentication policy represents a requirement that the identity of the entity that
sent a message or that defined the content of a message be established
in the message such that it can be authenticated by the message receiver.
A recipient authentication policy represents a requirement that the message be sent such
that the identity of the entities that can receive the message can be
established by the message sender. The providers apply specific message security mechanisms to
cause the message protection policies to be realized in the context of SOAP
web services messages.</p><p>Request and response message protection policies are defined when a provider is configured
into a container. Application-specific message protection policies (at the granularity of the web
service port or operation) may also be configured within the Sun-specific deployment descriptors
of the application or application client. In any case, where message protection policies are
defined, the request and response message protection policies of the client must match
(be equivalent to) the request and response message protection policies of the server.
For more information on defining application-specific message protection policies, refer to the <b>Securing Applications</b>
chapter of the <b>Developers Guide</b>.</p>

<a name="ablrx"></a><h4>Glossary of Message Security Terminology</h4>
<p>The terminology used in this document is described below. The concepts are also
discussed in <a href="#ablsb">Configuring the Enterprise Server for Message Security</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p>Authentication Layer</p><p>The <b>authentication layer</b> is the message layer on which authentication processing must be performed. The Enterprise Server enforces web services message security at the SOAP layer.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication Provider</p><p>In this release of the Enterprise Server, the Enterprise Server invokes <b>authentication</b> <b>providers</b> to process SOAP message layer security.</p>
<ul><li><p>A <b>client-side provider</b> establishes (by signature or username/password) the source identity of request messages and/or protects (by encryption) request messages such that they can only be viewed by their intended recipients. A client-side provider also establishes its container as an authorized recipient of a received response (by successfully decrypting it) and validates passwords or signatures in the response to authenticate the source identity associated with the response. Client-side providers configured in the Enterprise Server can be used to protect the request messages sent and the response messages received by server-side components (servlets and EJB components) acting as clients of other services.</p></li>
<li><p>A <b>server-side provider</b> establishes its container as an authorized recipient of a received request (by successfully decrypting it) and validates passwords or signatures in the request to authenticate the source identity associated with the request. A server-side provider also establishes (by signature or username/password) the source identity of response messages and/or protects (by encryption) response messages such that they can only be viewed by their intended recipients. <b>Server-side providers</b> are only invoked by server-side containers.</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>Default Server Provider</p><p>The <b>default server provider</b> is used to identify the server provider to be invoked for any application for which a specific server provider has not been bound. The <b>default server provider</b> is sometimes referred to as the <b>default provider.</b></p></li>
<li><p>Default Client Provider</p><p>The <b>default client provider</b> is used to identify the client provider to be invoked for any application for which a specific client provider has not been bound.</p></li>
<li><p>Request Policy</p><p>The <b>request policy</b> defines the authentication policy requirements associated with request processing performed by the authentication provider. Policies are expressed in message sender order such that a requirement that encryption occur after content would mean that the message receiver would expect to decrypt the message before validating the signature.</p></li>
<li><p>Response Policy</p><p>The <b>response policy</b> defines the authentication policy requirements associated with response processing performed by the authentication provider. Policies are expressed in message sender order such that a requirement that encryption occur after content would mean that the message receiver would expect to decrypt the message before validating the signature.</p></li></ul>


<a name="ablry"></a><h3>Securing a Web Service</h3>
<p>Web services deployed on the Enterprise Server are secured by binding SOAP layer
message security providers and message protection policies to the containers in which the
applications are deployed or to web service endpoints served by the applications. SOAP
layer message security functionality is configured in the client-side containers of the Enterprise
Server by binding SOAP layer message security providers and message protection policies to
the client containers or to the portable service references declared by client applications.</p><p>When the Enterprise Server is installed, SOAP layer message security providers are configured
in the client and server-side containers of the Enterprise Server, where they are
available for binding for use by the containers, or by individual applications or
clients deployed in the containers. During installation, the providers are configured with a
simple message protection policy that, if bound to a container, or to an
application or client in a container, would cause the source of the content
in all request and response messages to be authenticated by XML digital signature.</p><p>The administrative interfaces of the Enterprise Server can be employed to bind the
existing providers for use by the server-side containers of the Enterprise Server, to
modify the message protection policies enforced by the providers, or to create new
provider configurations with alternative message protection policies. Analogous administrative operations can be performed
on the SOAP message layer security configuration of the application client container as
defined in <a href="#gdhgg">Enabling Message Security for Application Clients</a>.</p><p>By default, message layer security is disabled on the Enterprise Server. To configure
message layer security for the Enterprise Server follow the steps outlined in <a href="#ablsb">Configuring the Enterprise Server for Message Security</a>.
If you want to cause web services security to be used to protect
all web services applications deployed on the Enterprise Server, follow the steps in
<a href="#gdhjn">Enabling Providers for Message Security</a>.</p><p>Once you have completed the above steps (which may include restarting the Enterprise
Server), web services security will be applied to all web services applications deployed
on the Enterprise Server.</p>

<a name="ablrz"></a><h4>Configuring Application-Specific Web Services Security</h4>
<p>Application-specific web services security functionality is configured (at application assembly) by defining message-security-binding
elements in the Sun-specific deployment descriptors of the application. These message-security-binding elements are used
to associate a specific provider or message protection policy with a web services
endpoint or service reference, and may be qualified so that they apply to
a specific port or method of the corresponding endpoint or referenced service.</p><p>For more information on defining application specific message protection policies, refer to <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-4336/beabg?a=view">Chapter 5, Securing Applications, in <i>Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server 2.1 Developer&#8217;s Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="ablsa"></a><h3>Securing the Sample Application</h3>
<p>The Enterprise Server ships with a sample application named <tt>xms</tt>. The <tt>xms</tt> application
features a simple web service that is implemented by both a J2EE EJB
endpoint and a Java Servlet endpoint. Both endpoints share the same service endpoint
interface. The service endpoint interface defines a single operation, <tt>sayHello</tt>, which takes a string
argument, and returns a <tt>String</tt> composed by pre-pending <tt>Hello</tt> to the invocation
argument.</p><p>The <tt>xms</tt> sample application is provided to demonstrate the use of the Enterprise
Server&#8217;s WS-Security functionality to secure an existing web services application. The instructions which
accompany the sample describe how to enable the WS-Security functionality of the Enterprise
Server such that it is used to secure the <tt>xms</tt> application. The sample also
demonstrates the binding of WS-Security functionality directly to the application (as described in
<a href="#ablrz">Configuring Application-Specific Web Services Security</a> application.</p><p>The <tt>xms</tt> sample application is installed in the directory: <i>as-install</i><tt>/samples/webservices/security/ejb/apps/xms/</tt>.</p><p>For information on compiling, packaging, and running the <tt>xms</tt> sample application, refer to
the<i> Securing Applications</i> chapter of the <i>Developers&#8217; Guide</i>.</p>

<a name="gdhce"></a><h4>Configuring Other Security Facilities</h4>
<p>The Enterprise Server implements message security using message security providers integrated in its
SOAP processing layer. The message security providers depend on other security facilities of
Enterprise Server.</p>
<ol><li><p>If using a version of the Java SDK prior to version 1.5.0, and using encryption technology, configure a JCE provider.</p></li>
<li><p>Configuring a JCE provider is discussed in <a href="#gdhbe">Configuring a JCE Provider</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If using a username token, configure a user database, if necessary. When using a username/password token, an appropriate realm must be configured and an appropriate user database must be configured for the realm.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage certificates and private keys, if necessary.</p></li></ol>


<a name="gdhcd"></a><h5>After You Finish</h5>
<p>Once the facilities of the Enterprise Server are configured for use by
message security providers, then the providers installed with the Enterprise Server may be enabled
as described in <a href="#gdhjn">Enabling Providers for Message Security</a>.</p>

<a name="gdhbe"></a><h4>Configuring a JCE Provider</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-91"></a><a name="indexterm-92"></a>The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provider included with J2SE 1.4.x does not support
<a name="indexterm-93"></a>RSA encryption. Because the XML Encryption defined by WS-Security is typically based on RSA
encryption, in order to use WS-Security to encrypt SOAP messages you must download
and install a JCE provider that supports RSA encryption.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>RSA is public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc. The acronym
stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman, the inventors of the technology.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are running the Enterprise Server on version 1.5 of the
Java SDK, the JCE provider is already configured properly. If you are running
the Enterprise Server on version 1.4.x of the Java SDK, you can add
a JCE provider statically as part of your JDK environment, as follows.</p>
<ol><li><p>Download and install a JCE provider JAR (Java ARchive) file. </p><p>The following URL provides a list of JCE providers that support RSA encryption: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jce/javase_providers.html">http://java.sun.com/products/jce/javase_providers.html</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the JCE provider JAR file to <i>java-home</i><tt>/jre/lib/ext/</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop the Enterprise Server. </p><p>If the Enterprise Server is not stopped and then restarted later in this process, the JCE provider will not be recognized by the Enterprise Server.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the <i>java-home</i><tt>/jre/lib/security/java.security</tt> properties file in any text editor. Add the JCE provider you&#8217;ve just downloaded to this file.</p><p>The <tt>java.security</tt> file contains detailed instructions for adding this provider. Basically, you need to add a line of the following format in a location with similar properties:</p><pre>security.provider.<i>n</i>=<i>provider-class-name</i></pre><p>In this example, <i>n</i> is the order of preference to be used by the Enterprise Server when evaluating security providers. Set <i>n</i> to <tt>2</tt> for the JCE provider you&#8217;ve just added.</p><p>For example, if you&#8217;ve downloaded The Legion of the Bouncy Castle JCE provider, you would add this line.</p><pre>security.provider.2=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.
   BouncyCastleProvider</pre><p>Make sure that the Sun security provider remains at the highest preference, with a value of 1.</p><pre>security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun</pre><p>Adjust the levels of the other security providers downward so that there is only one security provider at each level.</p><p>The following is an example of a <tt>java.security</tt> file that provides the necessary JCE provider and keeps the existing providers in the correct locations.</p><pre>security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
security.provider.2=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.
   BouncyCastleProvider
security.provider.3=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
security.provider.4=com.sun.rsajca.Provider
security.provider.5=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
security.provider.6=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider</pre></li>
<li><p>Save and close the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the Enterprise Server.</p></li></ol>


<a name="ablsd"></a><h3>Message Security Setup</h3>
<p>Most of the steps for setting up the Enterprise Server for using
message security can be accomplished using the Admin Console, the <tt>asadmin</tt> command-line tool, or
by manually editing system files. In general, editing system files is discouraged due
to the possibility of making unintended changes that prevent the Enterprise Server from
running properly, therefore, where possible, steps for configuring the Enterprise Server using the
Admin Console are shown first, with the <tt>asadmin</tt> tool command shown after. Steps
for manually editing system files are shown only when there is no Admin
Console or <tt>asadmin</tt> equivalent.</p><p>Support for message layer security is integrated into the Enterprise Server and its
client containers in the form of (pluggable) authentication modules. By default, message layer
security is disabled on the Enterprise Server. The following sections provide the details
for enabling, creating, editing, and deleting message security configurations and providers.</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#gdhjn">Enabling Providers for Message Security</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gdhbb">Configuring the Message Security Provider</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#gdhgv">Creating a Message Security Provider</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="#ablsl">Setting the Request and Response Policy for the Application Client Configuration</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablsm">Further Information</a></p></li></ul>
<p>In most cases, it will be necessary to restart the Enterprise Server
after performing the administrative operations listed above. This is especially the case if you
want the effects of the administrative change to be applied to applications that
were already deployed on the Enterprise Server at the time the operation was
performed.</p>

<a name="gdhjn"></a><h4>Enabling Providers for Message Security</h4>
<p>To enable message security for web services endpoints deployed in the Enterprise
Server, you must specify a provider to be used by default on the
server side. If you enable a default provider for message security, you also
need to enable providers to be used by clients of the web services
deployed in the Enterprise Server. Information for enabling the providers used by clients
is discussed in <a href="#gdhgg">Enabling Message Security for Application Clients</a>.</p><p>To enable message security for web service invocations originating from deployed endpoints, you
must specify a default client provider. If you enabled a default client provider
for the Enterprise Server, you must ensure that any services invoked from endpoints
deployed in the Enterprise Server are compatibly configured for message layer security.</p><p>Use the command-line utility:</p>
<ul><li><p>To specify the default server provider:</p><pre>asadmin  set --user  <i>admin-user</i> --port <i>admin-port</i> 
server-config.security-service.message-security-config.SOAP.
default_provider=ServerProvider</pre></li>
<li><p>To specify the default client provider:</p><pre>asadmin  set --user  <i>admin-user</i> --port <i>admin-port</i> 
server-config.security-service.message-security-config.SOAP.
default_client_provider=ClientProvider</pre></li></ul>


<a name="gdhbb"></a><h4>Configuring the Message Security Provider</h4>
<p>Typically, a provider would be re-configured to modify its message protection policies, although
the provider type, implementation class, and provider-specific configuration properties may also be modified.</p><p>Use the command-line utility to set the response policy, replace the word <tt>request</tt>
in the following commands with <tt>response</tt>.</p>
<ul><li><p>Add a request policy to the client and set the authentication source:</p><pre>asadmin  set --user  <i>admin-user</i> --port <i>admin-port</i> 
server-config.security-service.message-security-config.SOAP.
provider-config.ClientProvider.request-policy.auth_source=
sender | content</pre></li>
<li><p>Add a request policy to the server and set the authentication source:</p><pre>asadmin  set --user  <i>admin-user</i> --port <i>admin-port</i> 
server-config.security-service.message-security-config.SOAP.
provider-config.ServerProvider.request-policy.auth_source=
sender | content</pre></li>
<li><p>Add a request policy to the client and set the authentication recipient:</p><pre>asadmin  set --user  <i>admin-user</i> --port <i>admin-port</i> 
server-config.security-service.message-security-config.SOAP.
provider-config.ClientProvider.request-policy.auth_recipient=
before-content | after-content</pre></li>

<a name="gdhgv"></a><h4>Creating a Message Security Provider</h4>
<p>To configure an existing provider using the Admin Console, select Configuration node >
the instance to Configure> Security node > Message Security node > SOAP node
> Providers tab.</p><p>For more detailed instructions on creating a message security provider, see the Admin
Console online help.</p>

<a name="gdhgg"></a><h4>Enabling Message Security for Application Clients</h4>
<p>The message protection policies of client providers must be configured such that they
are equivalent to the message protection policies of the server-side providers they will
be interacting with. This is already the case for the providers configured (but
not enabled) when the Enterprise Server is installed.</p><p>To enable message security for client applications, modify the Enterprise Server specific configuration
for the application client container.</p>

<a name="ablsl"></a><h4>Setting the Request and Response Policy for the Application Client Configuration</h4>
<p>The <b>request and response policies</b> define the authentication policy requirements associated with request and response processing
performed by the authentication provider. Policies are expressed in message sender order such that
a requirement that encryption occur after content would mean that the message receiver
would expect to decrypt the message before validating the signature.</p><p>To achieve message security, the request and response policies must be enabled on
both the server and client. When configuring the policies on the client and
server, make sure that the client policy matches the server policy for request/response
protection at application-level message binding.</p><p>To set the request policy for the application client configuration, modify the Enterprise
Server specific configuration for the application client container as described in <a href="#gdhgg">Enabling Message Security for Application Clients</a>. In
the application client configuration file, add the <tt>request-policy</tt> and <tt>response-policy</tt> elements as shown to
set the request policy. </p><p>The other code is provided for reference. The other code may differ slightly
in your installation. Do not change it.</p><pre>&#60;client-container>
