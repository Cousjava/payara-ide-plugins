<a name="ablsw"></a>Chapter&#160;13<h3>Configuring the HTTP Service</h3><p>The HTTP service is the component of the Enterprise Server that provides facilities
for deploying web applications and for making deployed web applications accessible by HTTP
clients. These facilities are provided by means of two kinds of related objects,
virtual servers and HTTP listeners.</p><p>This chapter discusses the following topics:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#ablsz">Virtual Servers</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ablta">HTTP Listeners</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="ablsz"></a><h3>Virtual Servers</h3>
<a name="indexterm-117"></a><a name="indexterm-118"></a><p>A virtual server, sometimes called a virtual host, is an object that allows
the same physical server to host multiple Internet domain names. All virtual servers
hosted on the same physical server share the Internet Protocol (IP) address of
that physical server. A virtual server associates a domain name for a server
(such as <tt>www.aaa.com</tt>) with the particular server on which the Enterprise Server is
running.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Do not confuse an Internet domain with the administrative domain of the Enterprise
Server.</p>
<hr>
<p>For instance, assume you want to host these domains on your physical server:</p><pre>www.aaa.com
www.bbb.com
www.ccc.com</pre><p>Assume also that <tt>www.aaa.com</tt>, <tt>www.bbb.com</tt>, and <tt>www.ccc.com</tt> have web modules <tt>web1</tt>, <tt>web2</tt>, and
<tt>web3</tt>, respectively, associated with them.</p><p>This means that all of these URLs are handled by your physical
server:</p><pre>http://www.aaa.com:8080/web1
http://www.bbb.com:8080/web2
http://www.ccc.com:8080/web3</pre><p>The first URL is mapped to virtual host <tt>www.aaa.com</tt>, the second URL is
mapped to virtual host <tt>www.bbb.com</tt>, and the third is mapped to virtual host
<tt>www.ccc.com</tt>.</p><p>On the other hand, the following URL results in a 404 return
code, because <tt>web3</tt> isn&#8217;t registered with <tt>www.bbb.com</tt>:</p><pre>http://www.bbb.com:8080/web3</pre><p>For this mapping to work, make sure that <tt>www.aaa.com</tt>, <tt>www.bbb.com</tt>, and <tt>www.ccc.com</tt>
all resolve to your physical server&#8217;s IP address. They need to be registered
with the DNS server for your network. In addition, on a UNIX system,
add these domains to your <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> file (if the setting for <tt>hosts</tt> in your
<tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file includes <tt>files</tt>).</p><p>When the Enterprise Server is started, it starts the following virtual servers automatically:</p>
<ul><li><p>A virtual server named <tt>server</tt>, which hosts all user-defined web modules</p></li>
<li><p>A virtual server named <tt>__asadmin</tt>, which hosts all administration-related web modules (specifically, the Admin Console). This server is restricted; you cannot deploy web modules to this virtual server.</p></li></ul>
<p>For development, testing, and deployment of web services in a non-production environment, <tt>server</tt>
is often the only virtual server required. In a production environment, additional virtual
servers provide hosting facilities for users and customers so that each appears to
have its own web server, even though there is only one physical server.</p>

<a name="ablta"></a><h3>HTTP Listeners</h3>
<a name="indexterm-119"></a><a name="indexterm-120"></a><p>Each virtual server provides connections between the server and clients through one or
more HTTP listeners. Each HTTP listener is a listen socket that has an
IP address, a port number, a server name, and a default virtual server.</p><p>HTTP listeners must have a unique combination of port number and IP address.
For example, an HTTP listener can listen on all configured IP addresses on
a given port for a machine by specifying the IP address 0.0.0.0.
Alternatively, the HTTP listener can specify a unique IP address for each listener,
but use the same port.</p><p>Since an HTTP listener is a combination of IP address and port
number, you can have multiple HTTP listeners with the same IP address and
different port numbers (for example, 1.1.1.1:8081 and 1.1.1.1:8082), or with different IP addresses and
the same port number (for example, 1.1.1.1:8081 and 1.2.3.4:8081, if your machine was
configured to respond to both these addresses).</p><p>However, if an HTTP listener uses the 0.0.0.0 IP address, which listens on
all IP addresses on a port, you cannot create HTTP listeners for
additional IP addresses that listen on the same port for a specific IP
address. For example, if an HTTP listener uses 0.0.0.0:8080 (all IP addresses on
port 8080), another HTTP listener cannot use 1.2.3.4:8080.</p><p>Because the system running the Enterprise Server typically has access to only one
IP address, HTTP listeners typically use the 0.0.0.0 IP address and different port
numbers, with each port number serving a different purpose. If the system does
have access to more than one IP address, each address can serve a
different purpose.</p><p>By default, when the Enterprise Server starts, it has the following HTTP listeners:</p>
<ul><li><p>Two HTTP listeners named <tt>http-listener-1</tt> and <tt>http-listener-2</tt>, associated with the virtual server named <tt>server</tt>. </p></li>
<li><p>An HTTP listener named <tt>admin-listener</tt>, associated with the virtual server named <tt>__asadmin</tt>. </p></li></ul>
<p>All these listeners use the IP address 0.0.0.0 and the port numbers specified
as the HTTP server port numbers during installation of the Enterprise Server. If
the Enterprise Server uses the default port number values, <tt>http-listener-1</tt> uses port
8080, <tt>http-listener-2</tt> uses port 8181, and <tt>admin-listener</tt> uses port 48489.</p><p><a name="indexterm-121"></a>Each HTTP listener has a default virtual server. The default virtual server is
the server to which the HTTP listener routes all request URLs whose host
component does not match any of the virtual servers that are associated with
the HTTP listener (a virtual server is associated with an HTTP listener by
listing the HTTP listener in its <tt>http-listeners</tt> attribute).</p><p><a name="indexterm-122"></a><a name="indexterm-123"></a>In addition, specify the number of acceptor threads in the HTTP listener. Acceptor
threads accept new connections and put them onto a connection queue. Session threads
then pick up connections from the queue and service the requests. The server
posts more session threads if required at the end of the request.</p><p><a name="indexterm-124"></a><a name="indexterm-125"></a>A set of request processing threads retrieves incoming HTTP requests from the connection
queue and processes the requests. These threads parse the HTTP headers, select the
appropriate virtual server, and run through the request processing engine to service the request.
When there are no more requests to process, but the connection can be
kept persistent (either by using <tt>HTTP/1.1</tt> or sending a <tt>Connection: keep-alive</tt> header), the request
processing thread assumes the connection to be idle and passes the connection to
the Keep-Alive connection management subsystem.</p><p><a name="indexterm-126"></a><a name="indexterm-127"></a>The Keep-Alive subsystem periodically polls such idle connections and queues those connections with
activity into the connection queue for future processing.  From there, a request
processing thread again retrieves the connection and processes its request. The Keep-Alive subsystem is
multi-threaded, as it manages potentially tens of thousands of connections. Efficient polling techniques
are used, by dividing the number of connections into smaller subsets, to determine
which connections are ready with requests and which of those connections have idled
for sufficient time to deem them closed (beyond a maximum permissible Keep-Alive timeout).</p><p>The HTTP listener&#8217;s server name is the host name that appears in the
URLs the server sends to the client as part of a redirect.
This attribute affects URLs the server automatically generates; it does not affect the
URLs for directories and files stored in the server. This name is normally
the alias name if the server uses an alias. If a client sends
a <tt>Host:</tt> header, that host name supersedes the HTTP listener&#8217;s server name value
in redirects.</p><p>Specify a redirect port to use a different port number from that
specified in the original request. A <b>redirect</b> occurs in one of these situations:</p>
<ul><li><p>If a client tries to access a resource that no longer exists at the specified URL (that is, the resource has moved to another location), the server redirects the client to the new location (instead of returning a 404), by returning a designated response code and including the new location in the response&#8217;s Location header.</p></li>
<li><p>If a client tries to access a resource that is protected (for example, SSL) on the regular HTTP port, the server redirects the request to the SSL-enabled port. In this case, the server returns a new URL in the Location response header, in which the original insecure port has been replaced with the SSL-enabled port. The client then connects to this new URL.</p></li></ul>
<p>Specify also whether security is enabled for an HTTP listener and what kind
of security is used (for example, which SSL protocol and which ciphers).</p><p>To access a web application deployed on the Enterprise Server, use the
URL <tt>http://localhost:8080/</tt> (or <tt>https://localhost:8181/</tt> if it is a secure application), along with the
context root specified for the web application. To access the Admin Console, use
the URL <tt>https://localhost:4848/</tt> or <tt>http://localhost:4848/asadmin/</tt> (its default context root).</p><p>Because a virtual server must specify an existing HTTP listener, and because it
cannot specify an HTTP listener that is already being used by another virtual
server, create at least one HTTP listener before creating a new virtual server.</p>
